### Testing the Tool
For testing purposes, we've included additional files:

- **`example_xpub.txt`**: Contains a sample xpub for safe testing
- **`former_application_files/test_script.py`**: Comprehensive test script with additional features

## Interactive Workflow

The tool guides you through a comprehensive process:

### 1. Address Generation
1. **Choose Input Method**:
   - Enter xpub directly
   - Load xpub from file

2. **Set Number of Addresses**: 
   - Default: 10 addresses
   - Maximum recommended: 1000 (performance warning for larger numbers)

3. **Select Derivation Path**:
   - Standard receiving addresses (`m/0/i`)
   - Standard change addresses (`m/1/i`) 
   - Custom path (e.g., `44/0/0`, `0/0`)

4. **Starting Index**: Continue from previous derivations or start fresh

### 2. File Export Options

**TXT Export**: Save addresses to a timestamped text file with complete derivation information.

**CSV Export**: Create Electrum SV-compatible CSV files with amount distribution.

### 3. Amount Distribution (CSV Mode)

When creating CSV files, choose from three distribution algorithms:

#### Equal Distribution
- **Use Case**: Simple, uniform distribution
- **Behavior**: All addresses receive exactly the same amount
- **Example**: 100 BSV √∑ 10 addresses = 10 BSV each
- **Best For**: Basic splitting, transparent distributions

#### Manual Random Distribution
- **Use Case**: Custom randomization with user-defined bounds
- **Behavior**: Random amounts within specified min/max range
- **User Input**: Define minimum and maximum amounts per address
- **Example**: Min 0.5 BSV, Max 15 BSV per address
- **Best For**: Custom privacy requirements, specific amount ranges

#### Smart Random Distribution ü§ñ
- **Use Case**: Optimal randomization with automated bounds calculation
- **Behavior**: AI-powered distribution with intelligent bounds
- **Features**:
  - Automatically calculates optimal min/max bounds
  - Prevents excessive amounts to last address
  - Ensures true randomness across all addresses
  - Maintains reasonable variation while respecting constraints
  - Handles dust limit compliance automatically
  - Provides distribution quality analysis
- **Benefits**:
  - No manual bound calculation needed
  - Prevents common distribution pitfalls
  - Optimal privacy through controlled randomization
  - Quality metrics and analysis
- **Best For**: Professional use, large amounts, optimal privacy

### 4. Batch Processing üì¶

After creating a CSV, optionally split it into multiple batch files:

#### Features
- **Smart Splitting**: Split based on maximum BSV amount per batch
- **Privacy Enhancement**: Optional address randomization within batches
- **Organized Output**: Main CSV + subdirectory with batch files
- **Complete Traceability**: Batch info file with full statistics

#### Use Cases
- **Large Transactions**: Split 1000 addresses with 100 BSV into batches of max 10 BSV each
- **Operational Security**: Distribute large amounts across multiple files
- **Privacy**: Randomize address order to prevent correlation
- **File Management**: Easier processing of smaller, manageable files

#### Example Workflow
```
1000 addresses, 100 BSV total, max 10 BSV per batch
‚Üí Creates ~10 batch files + 1 info file in subdirectory
‚Üí Each batch: batch_01_9.87654321_BSV.csv, batch_02_10.00000000_BSV.csv, etc.
‚Üí Includes batch_info.txt with complete statistics
```

- Extended public keys can derive addresses but cannot spend funds
- Keep your private keys and extended private keys (xprv) secure and never share them
- Generated addresses are for receiving funds only
- **Batch processing enhances privacy** by splitting large transactions
- **Address randomization** provides additional privacy protection
- **Smart distribution** prevents common analysis patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

**IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## üîí CRITICAL SECURITY GUIDELINES

### Essential Security Practices

**üö® NEVER share or expose your private keys (xprv) or seed phrases**
- Private keys control your funds - anyone with access can steal your cryptocurrency
- This tool only needs your extended public key (xpub) - never input private keys
- Store private keys offline, encrypted, and in multiple secure locations

**üîë Extended Public Key (xpub) Security:**
- While xpubs can't spend funds, they reveal all your receiving addresses
- Sharing xpubs compromises your privacy and transaction history
- Only use xpubs from wallets you fully control
- Never use someone else's xpub or untrusted sources

**üíª Environment Security:**
- Use this tool only on secure, trusted computers
- Avoid public computers, shared systems, or compromised networks
- Keep your operating system and security software updated
- Use antivirus software and firewall protection

**üß™ Testing Protocol:**
- **ALWAYS test with small amounts first** before large transactions
- Verify generated addresses work correctly with test transactions
- Use testnet addresses for development and testing when possible
- Double-check all addresses before sending funds

### Address Verification Best Practices

**‚úÖ Before sending funds to generated addresses:**
1. **Verify the first few addresses** with small test amounts
2. **Compare generated addresses** with your wallet's receive addresses
3. **Check address format** matches Bitcoin SV standards
4. **Confirm you control the private keys** for the derivation path used

**üìã Address Usage Guidelines:**
- Each address should typically be used only once for privacy
- Monitor all generated addresses for incoming transactions  
- Keep detailed records of which addresses you've used
- Use batch processing for enhanced operational security

### Backup and Recovery

**üíæ Essential Backups:**
- **Backup your wallet's seed phrase** (12/24 words) securely offline
- **Store backups in multiple locations** (fireproof safe, safety deposit box)
- **Test recovery procedures** before you need them
- **Document your derivation paths** and starting indices

**üîÑ Recovery Planning:**
- Know how to restore your wallet from seed phrase
- Understand how to recreate addresses using derivation paths
- Keep copies of this tool or similar software for address regeneration
- Document all custom derivation paths used

### Operational Security

**üõ°Ô∏è Transaction Security:**
- Use hardware wallets when possible for enhanced security
- Verify transaction details carefully before broadcasting
- Use appropriate transaction fees to ensure timely confirmation
- Be aware of dust limits and minimum transaction amounts

**üîê Privacy Protection:**
- Use different addresses for different purposes
- Consider using mixing services for enhanced privacy
- Be cautious about address reuse and transaction linking
- Use batch processing to obscure transaction patterns

**‚ö†Ô∏è Red Flags - Stop and Investigate:**
- Unexpected address formats or patterns
- Addresses that don't match your wallet's generated addresses
- Requests to share private keys or seed phrases
- Pressure to make urgent transactions
- Unsolicited offers or "investment opportunities"

### Emergency Procedures

**üö® If you suspect compromise:**
1. **Immediately move funds** from potentially compromised addresses
2. **Generate new addresses** using a secure, clean system
3. **Review transaction history** for unauthorized activities
4. **Consider professional security consultation** for large amounts

**üìû When to Seek Help:**
- If you're unsure about any security aspect
- Before handling large amounts of cryptocurrency
- If you discover potential security issues
- When implementing new security procedures

---

**Remember: Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. Take security seriously and never risk more than you can afford to lose.**

## Privacy Features

### Enhanced Privacy Through:
- **Batch Processing**: Split large amounts across multiple files
- **Address Randomization**: Shuffle addresses to prevent correlation
- **Smart Amount Distribution**: Avoid predictable patterns
- **Variable Batch Sizes**: Prevent easy batch identification

### Best Practices:
1. Use smart random distribution for optimal privacy
2. Enable batch processing for large amounts (>10 BSV)
3. Use address randomization in random modes
4. Set reasonable maximum batch sizes (5-20 BSV)
5. Process batches independently and at different times

## Error Handling

The tool includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid extended public keys
- Invalid amount inputs and distribution parameters
- File access issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Invalid derivation paths
- Out-of-range indices
- Batch processing errors
